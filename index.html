            <p>
                Hi there! I'm a results-driven marketing and communications specialist based in the Stockholm region, Sweden, with a strong dedication to helping businesses grow and refine their digital persona. I am originally from Bucharest, Romania, where I lived until 2020, when I moved to the coolest capital in Scandinavia (no offense to the other equally fascinating Scandinavian capitals, I’m biased and admit it).
            </p>

            <p>
                I can bring to the table a diverse perspective and a wealth of experience from different industries and markets, as well as the energy required to drive change in your digital landscape.
            </p>

            <p>
                I offer services in:
            </p>

            <!--unordered List-->
            <ol type="1">
                <li>CRM administration and implementation – by the way, I’m a Salesforce Certified Admin</li> 
                <li>Marketing Automation – I am an expert in Salesforce Marketing Cloud, HubSpot and Sharpspring </li>  
                <li>Web Design and SEO</li>
                <li>Content and Copywriting</li>
                <li>Social media management</li>
                <li>SEM and paid social media campaigns.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                My rich experience with different business models can help translating your business requirements into functioning digital solutions. Whether it’s your website, CRM, or marketing automation platform, I excel at delivering solutions that fulfil exactly those business needs that are critical to creating and converting leads, delivering the message to the right audience at the right time or facilitate communication between your business and its customers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Besides, as an avid consumer of various forms of content, I understand the power of captivating storytelling and engaging communication. I believe that compelling and engaging content is one of the core assets of successful digital marketing strategies. I can craft social media campaigns, blog posts, or email marketing strategies that resonate with the group they’re intended to reach.
            </p>

            <p>
                With fluency in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Swedish, and Romanian, I possess the ability to connect with diverse and unique target audiences and navigate global markets. I thrive in both fast-paced as well as risk-averse and heavily regulated environments and have a proven track record of adapting quickly to industry trends and technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have successfully managed digital marketing campaigns with a strong emphasis on marketing automation. I have leveraged my expertise to drive customer engagement, lead generation, and revenue growth. Notably, I played a key role in developing the marketing automation strategy for the Young Professionals Attraction Index 2022, making a significant impact on the campaign's success.
            </p>

            <p>
                As of now, I am a contractor for pharma giant Novartis, where I help roll out their initiatives for 2024, especially focusing on <a href="https://medhub.se/" target="_blank">medhub.se</a>, <a href="http://novartis.se/" target="_blank">novartis.se</a> and the email marketing campaigns around their main events. 
            </p>

            <p>
                But throughout the years it has been a difficult race, one whose circumstances constantly forced me to adapt to fast-paced environments. This helped me gain significant insights from many different industries. Starting from managing Social Media accounts for <a href="https://adevarul.ro/" target="_blank">Adevărul</a>,  one of Romania’s most important daily publications, writing for <a href="https://www.bursa.ro/" target="_blank">bursa.ro</a> to supporting <a href="https://new.talktalk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Talktalk’s</a> sales operations, <a href="https://www.suunto.com/" target="_blank">Suunto’s</a> amazing sports watches, apps, and e-commerce, I am nowadays mostly working with complex marketing platforms and ecosystems, having managed a broad range of digital marketing campaigns, with an emphasis on marketing automation. I was one of Mellifiq’s main marketing administrators and <a href="https://academicwork.se/" target="_blank">Academic Work’s</a> main email marketing specialist, with a significant contribution to the marketing automation strategy for <a href="https://www.academicwork.se/foretag/ypai" target="_blank">Young Professionals Attraction Index 2022</a>.
                
            </p>
